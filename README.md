# Rasa Full-Stack Developer Take Home Task

Clone this repo, run `yarn install` and start the project using `yarn start`. 

## Instructions

Rasa is writing a new natural language classifier to sort useful concepts in tech from meaningless jargon.
One of the parts of it is what we call the `EntityHighlighter` which should allow users to highlight and 
identify parts of a string.

Here is what we expect from this component: 
- Users should be able to select different parts of the text and add an entity label for the selection;
- Selections with the same entity labels should be highlighted with the same color;
- Colors for different entity labels should be different;
- Of course, it should be suitable for usage in different parts of our application.

A colleague of yours submitted the complete implementation of `EntityHighlighter.js` in a pull request 
to be reviewed by you. Your goal is to identify and mark any issues with the pull request.
